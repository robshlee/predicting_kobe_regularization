# predicting_kobe_regularization

In this notebook I'll be demonstrating regularization penalties through linear models that predict how many shots Kobe Bryant made per game in his career. <br/><br/>

Please note I don't follow the NBA and thus don't have domain knowledge for this dataset. As a disclaimer, I believe domain knowledge is a key element in any analysis. That being said it's always been interesting to analyze data without any biases from knowing about the topic. It offers fresh perspective and the ability to truly allow the data to tell a story rather than trying to shape the story based on your preconceived notions.
